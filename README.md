## Description
A web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.


This is  a website for Akan people in Ghana.It contains the basic information about their culture and provides the best way to determine their names by just the dates that they were born.
when they enter their dates of birth in the form , the website automatically prints out their names
